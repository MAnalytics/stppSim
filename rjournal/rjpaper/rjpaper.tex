This file is only a basic article template. For full details of
\emph{The R Journal} style and information on how to prepare your
article for submission, see the
\href{https://journal.r-project.org/share/author-guide.pdf}{Instructions
for Authors}.

\hypertarget{about-this-format-and-the-r-journal-requirements}{%
\subsubsection{About this format and the R Journal
requirements}\label{about-this-format-and-the-r-journal-requirements}}

\texttt{rticles::rjournal\_article} will help you build the correct
files requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A R file will be generated automatically using \texttt{knitr::purl} -
  see \url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/purl.html} for
  more information.
\item
  A tex file will be generated from this Rmd file and correctly included
  in \texttt{RJwapper.tex} as expected to build \texttt{RJwrapper.pdf}.
\item
  All figure files will be kept in the default rmarkdown
  \texttt{*\_files} folder. This happens because
  \texttt{keep\_tex\ =\ TRUE} by default in
  \texttt{rticles::rjournal\_article}
\item
  Only the bib filename is to modifed. An example bib file is included
  in the template (\texttt{RJreferences.bib}) and you will have to name
  your bib file as the tex, R, and pdf files.
\end{itemize}
